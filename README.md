# Viper-Interpreter
An interpreter for a subset of Python using different techs under Windows

This project is still under developments, the features that have already been finished:

	LEXER:			Handle tokens and INDENT and DEDENTS
	PARSER:			All grammers has been set, yet there are only few semantic movements implemented
	DEBUGGER:		Store the process of lexing and parsing into a log file.
	INTERPRETER:		Interpret and move semantically according to the parsing process.

The features that are not so hurry to realize yet we wish to bring them on someday:

	Code Optimization
	Cross compiling
	GUI
How to run this:

	Turn on your windows
	Make sure that your g++ is in a directory the system environment variables as "Path"
	put source file in the master folder, simply drag a source file (*.vi) onto Drag.exe
